### Roots - Salt Stress - Forward Genetics - R


### Halloski! 

I am Magda and I work as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the group of [Prof. Mark Tester](http://saltyworld.org) in [KAUST](http://kaust.edu.sa), Saudi Arabia. In my research I focus on how salt stress affects plant architecture (especially the underground bit of the plant). 

## More background on my research:
Salt stress induces quiescence of growth through modification of cell cycle activity, cell expansion and cell wall extensibility. The period of initial growth arrest and the extent of recovered growth differs between individual organs leading to altered plant morphology. So far we studied altered morphology of Root System Architecture, by capturing growth dynamics in simple descriptive models. By examining natural variation therein we identified four distinct responses, which corresponded to maintenance of ion equilibrium in shoot tissue. When Root System Architecture data was used for Genome Wide Association Studies, we were able to identify a number of novel candidate genes as well as genes previously linked to salinity tolerance, for which we unravelled their role in root development. Our results show how study of growth dynamics lead to novel plant trait discovery, which is especially relevant in these times of fast development in plant phenotyping approaches.
