### Halloski! 

I am Magda and I work as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [group](http://saltyworld.org) of Prof. Mark Tester in [KAUST](http://kaust.edu.sa), Saudi Arabia. In my research I focus on how salt stress affects plant architecture (especially the underground bit of the plant). Recently, with a group of amazing PhD students in my group, I developed [MVApp](http://mvapp.kaust.edu.sa/MVApp/) - a webtool that is meant for streamlining the analysis of phenotypic data. You can find instructions on how to use it [here](https://mmjulkowska.github.io/MVApp/), and if you dont feel like reading we have youtube tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeTCqj3dHWbjIbt9cXVjHMQ).

## My bio:

I was born in [Zyrardow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BByrard%C3%B3w), a small industrial city in Poland build with red-bricks. My parents moved to the Netherlands, where I finished my high-school and started my intellectual germination at the University of Amsterdam. I got my BSc degree in General Biology and MSc degree in Green Life Science. During my MSc degree I did two fun MSc projects, first one in Amsterdam, focusing on [SnRK2.4/2.10 interaction with phospholipids](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3533798/) and the second one in Canberra, on [blue-light induced processes leading to germination of wheat](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23588419).

Later, my seedling brain was nurtured by Prof. Christa Testerink, during my PhD project. I studied [Root System Architecture of Arabidopsis HapMap population](http://www.plantcell.org/content/29/12/3198.long), developed a simple [Root-Fit model](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/166/3/1387.long) to describe stress-induced reprogramming of the architecture, and [explored the the salt induced changes in the rosette size](https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jxb/erw015). I also studied on protein-lipid interactions using [liposome binding assays](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-62703-401-2_24) focusing on the interactions between [Phosphatidic Acid and Arabidopsis SnRK2.4/2.10 proteins](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pce.12421). 

Right now I am having a post-doc fun in KAUST Saudi Arabia. I am focusing on (1) salt-induced changes in root-to-shoot ratio in Arabidopsis, (2) study the expression patterns in plants with enhanced sodium accumulation in their roots and (3) developing tools for data analysis based on R/Shiny. I am passionate about capturing plant architecture using simple models, understanding plant physiology and salinity tolerance. I love coding in R, BIG data analysis and sharing whatever I know with whomever cares to listen. 

I am an [active reviewer](https://publons.com/author/1329791/magdalena-m-julkowska#profile) for plant science journals, a [reviewing editor at Frontiers in Plant Science](https://loop.frontiersin.org/people/345613/overview) and a [Plantae Fellow](https://community.plantae.org/user/mmjulkowska) writting small paper summaries for ["What we're reading"](https://plantae.org/research/wwrtw/) series, which appears weakly on the Plantae website. You can find my bits [here](https://community.plantae.org/user/mmjulkowska/articles). 

Working at KAUST gives me a unique opportunity to experience culture and landscape that is very different from my own. You can read about my experiences of the Middle East on [my blog](https://mmjulkowska.wordpress.com/). 


## My passion for app development:

## More background on my research:
Salt stress induces quiescence of growth through modification of cell cycle activity, cell expansion and cell wall extensibility. The period of initial growth arrest and the extent of recovered growth differs between individual organs leading to altered plant morphology. So far we studied altered morphology of Root System Architecture, by capturing growth dynamics in simple descriptive models. By examining natural variation therein we identified four distinct responses, which corresponded to maintenance of ion equilibrium in shoot tissue. When Root System Architecture data was used for Genome Wide Association Studies, we were able to identify a number of novel candidate genes as well as genes previously linked to salinity tolerance, for which we unravelled their role in root development. Our results show how study of growth dynamics lead to novel plant trait discovery, which is especially relevant in these times of fast development in plant phenotyping approaches.
